# Copy to .env.development for local development and adjust values.
# This example no longer starts MailHog. Provide a real SMTP server or a local test SMTP instance if you
# want to capture outgoing mail during development.

# SMTP settings (set to your SMTP server for development testing)
Smtp__Host=smtp.example.local
Smtp__Port=587
Smtp__UseSsl=true
Smtp__User=
Smtp__Password=

# Recipient and optional from address (local/test)
Smtp__To=couple@example.com
Smtp__FromAddress=no-reply@example.com

# Notes:
# - If you want a local mail capture during development, run an SMTP catcher of your choice separately
#   (e.g., MailHog, MailDev, Papercut) and point Smtp__Host/Smtp__Port at it.
# - The entrypoint script requires Smtp__Host, Smtp__Port and Smtp__To to be set; the container will exit if missing.
